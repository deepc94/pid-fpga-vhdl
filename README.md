# PID Controller using FPGA

*Note: This code was written as part of a lab project in 2015. I do not work in this area anymore, and hence will not be able to assist you with understanding the code. Please read the attached technical report for guidance. Thank you!

Proportional-Integral-Derivative controllers are universal control structures and have been widely used in Automation systems, they are usually implemented either in hardware using Analog components or in software using Computer-based systems. The purpose of this project is to implement PID controllers on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) which improve speed, accuracy, power, compactness, and cost effectiveness over other digital implementation techniques. Finally, the PID controller can be used for applications such as DC motor speed control or Temperature controller.

The code has been written using VHDL language for the Spartan 3 - XC3S400 platform and can be simulated using the Xilinx ISE tool.
